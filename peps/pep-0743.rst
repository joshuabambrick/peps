Abstract
========

Add ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` and ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION_MAX`` macros
to opt-in for planned incompatible C API changes in a C extension.
Maintainers can decide when they make their C extension compatible
and also decide which future Python version they want to be compatible
with.


Rationale
=========

Python releases enforce C API changes
-------------------------------------

Every Python 3.x release has a long list of C API changes, including
incompatible changes. C extensions have to be updated to work on the
newly released Python.

Some incompatible changes are driven by new features: they cannot be
avoided, unless we decide to not add these features. Other reasons:

* Remove deprecated API (see :pep:`387`).
* Ease the implementation of another change.
* Change or remove error-prone API.

Currently, there is no middle ground between "not change the C API" and
"incompatible C API changes impact everybody". Either a C extension is
updated or the new Python version cannot be used. Such all-or-nothing
deal does not satisfy C extension maintainers nor C extensions users.


Limited C API
-------------

The limited C API is versioned: the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` macro can be set
to a Python version to select which API is available. On the Python
side, it allows introducing incompatible changes at a specific
``Py_LIMITED_API`` version. For example, if ``Py_LIMITED_API`` is set to
Python 3.11 or newer, the ``<stdio.h>`` is no longer included by
``Python.h``, whereas C extensions targeting Python 3.10 are not
affected.

The difference here is that upgrading Python does not change if
``<stdio.h>`` is included or not, but updating ``Py_LIMITED_API`` does.
Updating ``Py_LIMITED_API`` is an deliberate action made by the C
extension maintainer. It gives more freedom to decide **when** the
maintainer is ready to deal with the latest batch of incompatible
changes.

A similar version can be used with the regular (non-limited) C API.


Deprecation and compiler warnings
---------------------------------

Deprecated functions are marked with ``Py_DEPRECATED()``. Using a
deprecated function emits a compiler warning.

The problem is that ``pip`` and ``build`` tools hide compiler logs by
default, unless a build fails.  Moreover, it's easy to miss a single
warning in the middle of hundred lines of logs.

Schedule changes
----------------

Currently, there is no way to schedule a C API change: announce it but
also provide a way to maintainers to test their C extensions with the
change. Either a change is not made, or everybody must update their code
if they want to update Python.


Specification
=============

New macros
----------

Add new ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` and ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION_MAX``
macros. They can be set to test if a C extension is prepared for future
C API changes: compatible with future Python versions.

The ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` macro can be set to a specific Python
version. For example, ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION=0x030e0000`` tests C API
changes scheduled in Python 3.14.

If the ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` macro is set to
``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION_MAX``, all scheduled C API changes are tested at
once.

If the ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` macro is not set, it is to
``PY_VERSION_HEX`` by default.

The ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` macro can be set in a single C file or for
a whole project in compiler flags. The macro does not affected other
projects or Python itself.


Example in Python
-----------------

For example, the ``PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock()`` function is
deprecated in Python 3.13 and scheduled for removal in Python 3.15. The
function can be declared in the Python C API with the following
declaration:

.. code-block:: c

    #if Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION < 0x030f0000
    Py_DEPRECATED(3.13) PyAPI_FUNC(PyObject *) PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock(
        const char *name            /* UTF-8 encoded string */
        );
    #endif

If ``if Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` is equal to or greater than Python 3.15
(``0x030f0000``), the ``PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock()`` function is not
declared, and so using it fails with a build error.

Goals
-----

* Reduce the number of C API changes affecting C extensions when
  updating Python.
* When testing C extensions (for example, optional CI test),
  ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` can be set to ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION_MAX``
  to detect future incompatibilities. For mandatory tests, it is
  recommended to set ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` to a specific Python
  version.
* For core developers, make sure that the C API can still evolve
  without being afraid of breaking an unknown number of C extensions.

Non-goals
---------

* Freeze the API forever: this is not the stable ABI. For example,
  deprecated functions will continue to be removed on a regular basis.
* C extensions maintainers not using ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` will
  still be affected by C API changes when updating Python.
* Provide a stable ABI: the macro only impacts the regular (non-limited)
  API.
* Silver bullet solving all C API issues.


Examples of ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` usages
============================================

* Remove deprecated functions.
* Remove deprecated structure members, such as
  ``PyBytesObject.ob_shash``.
* Remove a standard ``#include``, such as ``#include <string.h>``,
  from ``<Python.h>``.
* Change the behavior of a function or a macro. For example, calling
  ``PyObject_SetAttr(obj, name, NULL)`` can fail, to enforce the usage
  of the ``PyObject_DelAttr()`` function instead to delete an attribute.


Implementation
==============

* `Issue gh-116587 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116587>`_
* PR: `Add Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION and Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION_MAX macros
  <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116588>`_


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There is no impact on backward compatibility.

Adding ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` and ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION_MAX``
macros has no effect on backward compatibility. Only developers setting
the ``Py_COMPAT_API_VERSION`` macro in their project will be impacted by
effects of this macro which is the expected behavior.

Prior Art
=========

* ``Py_LIMITED_API`` macro of :pep:`384` "Defining a Stable ABI".
* Rejected :pep:`606` "Python Compatibility Version" which has a global
  scope.
